-- #2, 3, 4 Some Java or C++ equivalent to Haskel...

-- #5 Show that a + a = 2 Ã— a holds for types (up to isomorphism). Re-
-- member that 2 corresponds to Bool , according to our translation
-- table.

-- a + a = 2 x a

-- a + a = a x (1 + 1) => Distributivity (isomorphism)
-- a + a = (a x 1) + (a x 1)
